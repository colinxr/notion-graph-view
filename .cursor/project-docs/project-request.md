# Notion Graph View

## Project Description

A SaaS application that creates interactive graph visualizations of users' Notion databases, showing connections between backlinked pages. Users can explore relationships between their Notion pages, view details about specific notes, and navigate directly to the corresponding Notion page. The graph visualization can be embedded within Notion pages.
