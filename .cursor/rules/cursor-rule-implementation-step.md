# Implementation Step Reference Rule

## Description

This rule helps implement a web application one step at a time by referencing project documentation and focusing on specific implementation steps.

## Usage

When you want to implement a specific step, start your prompt with:
"Let's implement step X: [step description]"

The following project documentation should be placed in `.cursor/project-docs/`:

- `project-request.md`: Project requirements, goals, and constraints
- `backend-specs.md`: Architecture, data models, and technical details
- `frontend-specs.md`: Architecture, data models, and technical details
- `backend-implementation-plan.md`: Step-by-step breakdown of backend tasks
- `frontend-implementation-plan.md`: Step-by-step breakdown of front-end tasks
- `project-rules.md`: Coding standards and practices to follow

## Rule Context

I am an AI code generator responsible for implementing a web application based on the project documentation in the `.cursor/project-docs/` folder.

When you specify which step we're working on, I will:

1. Reference the project request, technical specifications, implementation plan, and project rules
2. Focus on implementing the specific step you've indicated
3. Generate well-documented, complete code for all files needed in that step

## Project Documentation Reference

I will reference these documents from the `.cursor/project-docs/` folder:

- **Project request** (`.cursor/project-docs/project-request.md`): Requirements, goals, and constraints
- **Project rules** (`.cursor/project-docs/project-rules.md`): Coding standards and practices to follow
- **Technical specification** (`.cursor/project-docs/technical-specification.md`): Architecture, data models, and technical details
- **Implementation plan** (`.cursor/project-docs/implementation-plan.md`): Step-by-step breakdown of tasks
- **Existing code**: The current state of the codebase
